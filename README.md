This repository was created to maintain the assignments of UW CSEP 527.
We worked on some interesting problems using Hidden Markov Models, Viterbi algorithm, Gillespie algorithm, Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm, and many others.

| Biological Problem | Attempted Algorithm |
| :----------------: | :-----------------: |
| Population Evolution | Gillespie |
| Genome Alignment | Smith Waterman |
| RNA Transcript Abundance Estimation | Expectation Maximization |
| Cluster Cell Types Based On Gene Expression (Single-Cell Analysis) | Dimensionality Reduction (T-SNE) / K-Means Clustering |
| Differential Analysis | T-tests |
| Learning Sequences from Observed Data | Viterbi / Hidden Markov Models |
| Alternative Splicing Prediction | Gradient Descent for L2 Regularized KL-Loss Logistic Regression |
