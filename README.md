This repository was created to maintain the assignments of UW CSEP 527.
We worked on some interesting problems using Hidden Markov Models, Viterbi algorithm, Gillespie algorithm, Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm, and many others.

| Biological Problem | Attempted Algorithm |
| Genome Alignment | Smith Waterman |
| Learning Sequences from Observed Data | Viterbi |
| Population Evolution | Gillespie |
